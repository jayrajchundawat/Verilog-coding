# Verilog-coding
"Collection of basic Verilog modules with testbenches – for daily hardware design practice."
This repository contains a structured collection of Verilog modules and their corresponding testbenches, created as part of my daily hardware design practice using Verilog HDL.

Topics Covered

The repository contains a wide range of digital design topics:

- **Combinational Circuits**  
  Adders, Comparators, Encoders, Decoders, Multiplexers, Demultiplexers, 7-Segment Display Controllers, ALUs

- **Sequential Circuits**  
  Flip-Flops, Shift Registers, Counters (Up/Down), Clock Dividers, Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs)

- **Memory Modules**  
  Single-Port SRAM and Dual-Port SRAM designs

- **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**  
  Implementations of Mealy and Moore machines

---

Tools Used

All modules are written in Verilog and tested using:
- **ModelSim** – for simulation
- **Yosys** – for synthesis and gate-level flow

Folder Structure

Each topic is organized into its own folder containing:
- `design.v` – Verilog module
- `testbench.v` – Verilog testbench for simulation
